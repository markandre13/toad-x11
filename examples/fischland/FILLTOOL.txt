TFPath* floodfill(TFigureModel &model, TCoord x, TCoord y)
  this is the flood fill function

  1. find a figure which is nearest to points (x, y) left side
  1.1 calculate all intersections with a horizontal line
  1.2 find the nearest intersection on the left
  
  -> TFPath *nearpath, nearx, neara
  
  2. find all figures which intersect with 'nearpath'
     and which intersections are near to 'neara' on nearpath


  
o The intersection algorithm can not be improved, thus we do need to make
  the fill algorithm more robust.

o We need to create a database of pictures in which the fill algorithm
  failed.
  
o Add a button to the GUI to generate snapshots of which can be used for
  debugging.
