1. SMALLPRINT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  The TOAD C++ GUI Library is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser
  General Public License (LGPL) See the file COPYING.LIB for more details.

  Some programs coming with the TOAD C++ GUI Library may be under the terms
  of the GNU General Public License (GPL). See the file COPYING for more
  details.

  The TOAD C++ GUI Library comes WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the
  implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.


2. A WORD OF WARNING
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Current releases are named 0.x.y indicating that the TOAD C++ GUI Library
  is still under construction and a lot of things may change from one
  release to another.

   But if you want to experiment with a GNU LGPLed C++ GUI toolkit this
  one might be the right stuff for you.


3. WHAT IS THE TOAD C++ GUI LIBRARY?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   The TOAD C++ GUI Library is a set of C++ classes for developing X Window
  applications. Since there are so many other GUI libraries around (the
  living ones: GTK+, Qt, LessTif, Motif, fltk, Xclasses, notif, OpenLook,
  wxWindows, Fox and the dead ones: SUIT, Andrew Toolkit, InterViews,
  Fresco, XForms, ET++, Common Point and many more) you may ask yourself why
  one should use the TOAD C++ GUI Library? Take a look at it and you will
  see the answer (or not ;) ).
  

4. REQUIREMENTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - GNU Make 3.75
  - GNU C++ Compiler 3.0 or later
  - GNU libstd++ 3.0 or later
  - later than GNU Binutils 2.9.1
  - GNU C library 2.1 or later
  - X Window System, Version 11, Release 6 or later
  - zlib 1.1.1
  - libpng 1.0.1
  - libxml2

  The TOAD C++ GUI Library has been tested on the following platforms:
  - Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (current)
  - AIX (as of TOAD 0.42.19 and 0.42.20)
  - SunOS (only the early releases)
  and will probably run on any other Linux, Hurd or FreeBSD compatible 
  system.


5. USING THE TOAD C++ GUI LIBRARY
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 5.1 RUNNING EXAMPLES WITHOUT INSTALLATION

  - run 
      ./configure && make
    or when your C++ compiler has another name
    set the CXX environment variable. Ie.
      CXX=g++-3.0 ./configure && make
    on Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (aka Woody)
  - change to one of the directories in `examples/'
  - run `make'
  - run `make run'
    (should work when your system supports LD_LIBRARY_PATH and only the
    TOAD library is missed by the linker)

 5.2 WRITING PROGRAMS WITHOUT INSTALLATION

  - Run `build', type [1] and [0]
  - Copy or link `toad/conf/MakefilePrg' to `~/.TOADMakefile' (or something
    alike)
  - Copy the files from `toad/examples/skeletons/menubar/' to a new directory
  - Change the last line in `Makefile' to `include ~/.TOADMakefile'
  - hack
  - Run `make'
  - Run `make run'

 5.3 FULL INSTALLATION

  - Run `build', type [1] and [2], follow the instructions and you're done.


6. DOCUMENTATION AND HELP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - a programming manual is planned after the release of version 1.0

  - When you have PERL and a WebBrowser installed, move to the
    `doc/reference' directory, run make and view the "index.html" file.

  - There's a WWW site regarding the TOAD C++ GUI Library:
  
                         http://www.mark13.de/toad/

    and a mailing list.

    To subscribe the list just send an empty eMail to
    
                   toad-dev-subscribe@list.innominate.org

    and send a reply to confirm that you really want to join the list.
    You may then send messages to

                        toad-dev@list.innominate.org

    To unsubscribe from the list send an empty eMail to

                  toad-dev-unsubscribe@list.innominate.org


7. HOW THE SOURCE IS ORGANISED
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(out of date)

src/                    : the library source
src/Makefile            : Makefile for the library

examples/               : some example programs
examples/<dir>/Makefile	: simplified Makefile for <dir> which includes
                          conf/MakefilePrg
conf/MakefilePrg        : the Makefile to build programs

doc/                    : some documentation

construction/           : sources where new features are created and
                          tested
                          
testsuite/              : programs that should compile for a valid release

8. DEBUGGING
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Hints for the FSF's GNU Compiler and Debugger:
  
  GCC 3.2 C++ ABI
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  use this when compiling gcc 3.2
  --enable-__cxa_atexit --enable-threads=posix --enable-shared

  tips to trace exceptions or fatal errors
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  - As this release requires g++-3.x you should update your debugger to
    gdb-5.2 or above and create a file ~/.gdbinit with this content:

    set print pretty on 
    set print object on
    set print static-members on
    set print vtbl on 
    set print demangle on 
    set demangle-style gnu-v3

  - set breakpoint at `exit'
  - set breakpoint at `__cxa_throw' to find the place where C++
    exceptions are thrown


  tips to trace memory bugs with glibc and the library
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  - enable `DEFINES = -DDEBUG_MEMORY' in src/Makefile before compiling
    the library

  - link program with `-lmcheck' or set the environment variable 
    `MALLOC_CHECK_' to
      0: any detected heap corruption is silently ignored
      1: a diagnostic is printed on `stderr'
      2: `abort' is called immediately

  - set the environment variable `MALLOC_TRACE' to the name of a logfile; 
    get a report afterwards with `mtrace <program> <logfile>'.
