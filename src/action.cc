/**
 * \class toad::TAction
 *
 * TAction is a kind of invisible button widget and was introduced to
 * decouple the widgets from the menubar.
 *
 * For example, the TTextArea widget creates TAction children for cut, copy
 * and paste and connects their signals to its methods.
 *
 * Other widgets with a visual representation like TMenuBar or TToolBar will
 * use a list of all available actions (provided in TAction::actions) and
 * trigger the actions signal.
 *
 * \todo
 *   \li
 *     Currently the actions look is controlled by the menubar which is
 *     wrong.
